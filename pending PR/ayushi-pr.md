Hello GSSOC Team, This is a level 3 PR (Assigned by the PA) which hasn't been merged : https://github.com/Manishkr1007/WordWeaver/pull/147#issuecomment-2457861698

since i had to make a lot of changes that is replacing appwrite with node backend leading to changing both fronted and backend. and creating a whole new backend folder lots of conflicts raised which are not resolvable.
but the problem is with the PA who is not responding and active.
